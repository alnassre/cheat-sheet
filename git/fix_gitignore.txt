git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m ".gitignore fix"


# or 

git rm --cached <file>
git rm -r --cached <folder>



#Step 1: Commit all your changes
#Before proceeding, make sure all your changes are committed, including your .gitignore file.

#Step 2: Remove everything from the repository
#To clear your repo, use:

git rm -r --cached .
#rm is the remove command
#-r will allow recursive removal
#â€“cached will only remove files from the index. Your files will still be there.
#The . indicates that all files will be untracked. You can untrack a specific file with git rm --cached foo.txt (thanks @amadeann).
#The rm command can be unforgiving. If you wish to try what it does beforehand, add the -n or --dry-run flag to test things out.

#Step 3: Re add everything
git add .
#Step 4: Commit
git commit -m ".gitignore fix"
#Your repository is clean :)

#Push the changes to your remote to see the changes effective there as well.
